# Neural_Networks
## How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I initially selected 33 neurons and 66 layers. I used 33 because the data array was 33
## Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
No, I could not achieve 75% accuracy
## If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
 I would use support vector machine (SVM) as it requires less code.
